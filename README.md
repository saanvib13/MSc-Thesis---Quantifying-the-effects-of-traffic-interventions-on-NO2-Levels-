# MSc-Thesis: Quantifying-the-effects-of-traffic-interventions-on-NO2-Levels-
Code for a data-driven framework to quantify how short-term traffic interventions change urban NO₂ in Cork City. Integrates NO₂, meteorology, traffic and calendar data with changepoint-derived features (segment mean NO₂). Compares Random Forest and LSTM; detects localized reductions and improves predictions.
